Overview:
---------

libplaysound is a thin GObject wrapper around libcanberra, a C implementation of
the XDG Sound Theme and Name specifications. Libplaysound is not designed to be
used from C, where it would be much more convenient to use libcanberra directly.
Instead, libplaysound is designed to be used by language bindings via
the use of GObject Introspection.

libplaysound is written in Vala, using the libcanberra Vala bindings.

Prerequisites:
--------------

Building libplaysound from a distributed tarball requires GObject, GIO,
libcanberra, and (optionally) Gtk3 development headers to be installed.

Building from a Git checkout additionally requires the Vala compiler and the
libcanberra Vala bindings to be installed.
